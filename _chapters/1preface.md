### 1.1 The Goal of this Guide

The goal of this guide is to provide an introduction to how to conduct neuroimaging studies in an open science framework. The guide will be structured by the four main principles of Open Source, Open Methodology, Open Data, and Open Access. For each part there will be a description of the available tools (software, platforms, etc.). There is wide range of different options, so only a subset will be described in more detail. You will find links to tutorials, downloads and in-depth information along the way. All of these will also be collected in the appendix to make finding each of these resources more easily. Additionally there will be Hands-On sections which are meant as short tutorials for key tools.
