title: "Shared etiology of autism and autistic traits"
---
In my Bachelor thesis I developed the theory that autism represents the extreme end of a complex dimensional trait. Additionally I hypothesized that this trait underwent a recent evolutionary change which enabled humans to do complex social cognition, for example of the type that is known as Theory of Mind. (You can view [my thesis on OSF](https://osf.io/u873y/), it is in German though)

Recently I stumbled upon a paper that seems to support this view. The study by [Robinson et al. (2011)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.119) compares the heritability of clinical autism and autistic traits in a twin study. The authors demonstrate that both are similarly heritable. They conclude that both share an etiology, supporting the view of "autism spectrum disorders as the quantitative
extreme of a neurodevelopmental continuum."
